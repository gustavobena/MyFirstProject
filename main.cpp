	Above is the format you should follow for all files you turn in. This area has
	been setup as a multi-line comment because it is surrounded by a forward-slash-star
	on the front and a star-forward-slash on the end. Comments are ignored by the
	complier and used to help you and others to read and understand your code. I will
	be adding comments to help you understand what the code contained in this file does.

*/

//	This is a comment. Single line comments begin with a double forward slash (//).

/*	We are using a preprocessor directive here to include the iostream library. This is
	the input/output stream library. There exist many premade/precomplied libraries that
	can be helpful. We will extensively be using the collection of libraries known as
	the standard library which includes iostream.
